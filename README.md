## Features

- **Real-time gameplay** using WebSocket communication
- **Beautiful modern UI** with responsive design
- **Game state management** with automatic cleanup
- **Chat system** for player communication
- **Timer system** with 10-minute game duration

## How to Play

### Game objective
This is a word guessing game with 2 players - a hider and seeker. Hider aims to hide the word from the seeker while seeker tries to seek it out.

### Game Setup
1. **Player 1 (Game Creator)**: 
   - Visit the game homepage
   - Click "Create Game" to generate a unique game link
   - Share the link with Player 2
   - Choose your role (Hider or Seeker) and enter your name

2. **Player 2 (Joiner)**:
   - Click the shared link or enter the game ID manually
   - Choose the opposite role and enter your name
   - Both players will be redirected to the game page

### Gameplay
- Seeker : Seeker gives a description of a scene which hider will use to generate an image with the hidden object. The scene description can be as detailed or vague as desired. Example - a snow capped mountain.
- Hider : Once hider receives the seeker's prompt, they will devise their own prompt for an image. This prompt should fulfill the seeker's scene description and also contain the hidden object. For example, if the hidden object is bottle, for the above seeker's prompt, the hider's prompt can be - "an image of a mountaineer climbing a snow capped mountain. The mountaineer has a red backpack with a bunny keychain and is drinking water out of a bottle. He is wearing sunglasses. " 
The hider can edit this image sequentially with more prompts until they are satisfied and then send this image to the seeker. To make an edit to the existing image, enter the prompt with [edit] as the first word
- Seeker - The seeker then sees the generated image and either makes a guess for the hidden object or gives another scene description. The process then continues until time runs out or seeker makes the right guess.
For example, based on the image, the seeker could give another prompt as - image of a forest without any people. The hider's challenge is to now again generate an image with the bottle but also make it such that it obfuscates it from the seeker. So, for example, the hider could create an object with a forest with bunnies hopping aroung and trash lying around which includes thrown away bottles and sunglasses.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Export the Replicate api token**
   ```
   export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<Your API Token>
   ```
3. **Run the game server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the game**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
   - The server will be accessible on your local network at `http://[your-ip]:5000`

## How to Run as Two Players

### Method 1: Same Computer (Two Browser Tabs)
1. Start the server: `python app.py`
2. Open two browser tabs/windows
3. In the first tab: Create a game and copy the link
4. In the second tab: Paste the link to join
5. Choose different roles and start playing!

### Method 2: Different Computers (Local Network)
1. Start the server: `python app.py`
2. Find your computer's IP address:
   - **Mac/Linux**: `ifconfig` or `ip addr`
   - **Windows**: `ipconfig`
3. Player 1: Open `http://[your-ip]:5000` in their browser
4. Player 2: Open the same URL in their browser
5. Create and join the game as described above

### Method 3: Internet (Port Forwarding)
1. Configure your router to forward port 5000 to your computer
2. Use your public IP address instead of localhost
3. Both players can access the game from anywhere on the internet


## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask with Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication. Flux-kontext model is run on replicate for image generation.
- **Frontend**: HTML5 Canvas for game rendering, vanilla JavaScript
- **Communication**: WebSocket for real-time updates
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with responsive design

### Key Features
- **Session Management**: Players are tracked with unique IDs
- **Room-based Communication**: Each game has its own WebSocket room
- **State Synchronization**: Game state is synchronized between players
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of disconnections and errors
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Module not found" errors**:
   - Make sure you've installed all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Can't connect to the game**:
   - Check if the server is running on the correct port
   - Ensure firewall settings allow connections on port 5000
   - Try using `localhost` instead of IP address for local testing

3. **Players can't see each other**:
   - Make sure both players are using the same game ID
   - Check that WebSocket connections are established (check browser console)

4. **Game not starting**:
   - Ensure both players have joined and selected different roles
   - Check that the "Start Game" button appears for both players

### Debug Mode
To run with debug information:
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development
python app.py
```
